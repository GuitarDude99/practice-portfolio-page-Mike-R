<h1>About Me</h1>

<body>  I am a working creative professional based in the St. Louis area. My areas of expertise include electric guitar (Live performence) and photography (portraits, fashion, editorial, products.)
    After years of independent and private study, I continued to hone my skills at the Universuty of Missouri St. Louis. After graduation, I moved to Nashville TN to work as a touring guitarist.
    Following my time in Nashville, I made the decision to move back to St. Louis to be closer to family, and continue my career.
    If you are interested in learning more about the expertise I can provide and my pricing, please feel free to contact me at the email address listed.
